====================

ONE-SHOT is a forkable conference created by NodeConf.

The main NodeConf events around the world are rather large productions and require a big commitment of time and financial risk. ONE-SHOT was created as a much simpler single day speaker series event that people around the world can pick up and run without a huge time commitment or considerable financial risk.
